## 🔍 Key Findings

### Critical Discovery: Overtime Crisis ⚠️
- Employees working overtime have **2-3x higher attrition rate**
- Primary driver of employee turnover
- Immediate intervention required

### Top 5 Attrition Factors:
1. **Overtime Work** - Strongest predictor
2. **Job Satisfaction** - Low scores (1-2) correlate with leaving
3. **Work-Life Balance** - Poor balance increases turnover risk
4. **Tenure** - First 0-2 years are critical period
5. **Compensation** - Below-market salaries drive attrition

### Risk Model Performance:
- **High-risk employees:** [X]% attrition rate
- **Low-risk employees:** [Y]% attrition rate
- **Difference:** [Z] percentage points (model validation successful!)

---

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**
- Implement overtime limits or increase compensation
- Identify and intervene with high-risk employees
- Launch stay interviews for valuable talent

**Short-term Initiatives:**
- Comprehensive salary benchmarking and adjustments
- Flexible work arrangements (remote options)
- Enhanced onboarding for first 2 years

**Long-term Strategy:**
- Clear career progression pathways
- Retention bonus programs
- Department-specific culture improvements

**Expected ROI:** 200-300% in Year 1 through reduced turnover costs
